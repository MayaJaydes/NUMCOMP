Major: Photonic Science and Engineering
Year: 2nd (Sophomore)
ID: 5114211
How did you hear about this course?
My Advisor in CREOL, Mike McKee recommended this course as a substitute for ENG3211 because it focuses more on python, which I will use as an optics major.
Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.?
Yes
What operating system and version does it run?
Windows 10 64-bit
How much free disk space does it have?
797GB
What operating systems are you comfortable working in?
Mostly just Windows as I have never owned a MAC or any laptop with a operating system other than Windows.
What computer classes have you taken, including high school, extracurricular, etc.?
I have taken computer classes focusing on gaining our certifications in AutoDesk programs such as AutoCAD and Inventor.
Have you ever programmed a computer?
No
In what language(s)? N/A
Summarize your experience: N/A
Have you taken statistics or probability?
Yes, I took and passed the AP test for AP Statistics in high school.
Why are you taking this course?
To fulfill a prerequisite for my major as well as learn more about computer programming with Python.
Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
No particular topics, as I am completely new to programming.
If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly describe your experience:
In my Physics I lab last semester we worked with scientific data and modeling as part of our group experiments. Some of my team members used python to input the data and calculate t' scores though I did not use it. It seemed time consuming and difficult since we all had no idea what Python was.
Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar?  If so, describe:
I was involved in my school's science fair back in middle school.

*****OUT: Thurs Aug 26 19:12:26 EST 2021


*****IN: Tues Aug 31 21:00:07 EST 2021

Moved NUMCOMP folder to C:\Users\Maya's Computer\Downloads\NUMCOMP from Knights OneDrive (as shown in entry 1)
Created a folder within NUMCOMP called 'Handin' where I will be putting the compressed zip files of the homework that I turn in
Renamed log in Atom from 'HW1_MayaSosa' to 'Main Log'

Opened Microsoft Store and downloaded Ubuntu (previously enabled Windows Subsystem for Linux through Control Panel→Programs→Turn Windows Features On Or Off and restarted computer)
Followed prompts and created a username and password for Ubuntu
Played around with commands learned in class such as: cp, mv, and wc

1a) Done Previously:
Opened Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda) through Windows start button
Followed win10-software.pdf under PHZ3150>Files>Handouts>Installation Instructions in Webcourses to update miniconda and install Jupyter
Typed: "conda update --all" in Anaconda Prompt and followed prompts to update miniconda
Added packages to conda by typing "conda install numpy scipy ipython matplotlib" and following prompts
Installed conda by typing "conda install jupyter" and following prompts
Done Now:
Opened Jupyter notebook Windows Start>Anaconda3 (64-bit)>Jupyter notebook
Copied link shown in notebook by highlighting and using keyboard commands ctrl + c and then pasted in chrome search bar using ctrl + v
Clicked New->Python3->Help->About to get information on Python version (Python 3.9.6) and used keyboard commands start + prtscr to take screenshot, right clicked on file and renamed it HW2_MayaSosa_JupyterNotebook_scrnsht

1b) Vistited https://desktop.github.com/ and clicked download to download Github desktop
Opened .exe file that was downloaded and logged into my existing account that was already synced with classroom phz3150 / phz3150_main_dir
Took a screenshot using keyboard commands used previously, right cicked on file and renamed it HW1_MayaSosa_Gitbub_scrnsht

2) I have no idea what syntax and tokens are so I'm just assuming syntax is word structure and tokens are punctuation
The bird high really flew today.
The! bird flew really, high today?
What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why?
Natural language is very complex and abstract, for example we have multiple meanings for the same word based on the location a speaker comes from. Computers use very precise language for certain actions, and natural language is ever changing and evolving, but as native speakers we can understand the changes where computers cannot.

3) Opened link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and followed Github hello-world tutorial
Went into the class Files>Homework>HW1 and downloaded hw1-survey.txt
Went to phz3150_main_dir-MayaJaydes/HW/HW1/ in Github and dragged and dropped hw1-survey.txt file
Committed the change with message of "Added Files: Added hw1-survey.txt as required for HW2" and took screenshot using previous keyboard commands, renaming it Hw2_MayaSosa_Github_AddedFiles_scrnsht

*****IN Tues Sept 8 13:38:45 EST 2021

Start HW 3

Problem 1:
Went to Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin and selected "New Folder"
Renamed folder "HW3_MayaSosa"
Deleted folder (so I could make it again through the terminal in problem 2)

Problem 2:
Under Windows Start opened Ubuntu
a) To make directory: mkdir Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa
  To make that my current directory:  cd Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa
  To list: ls (it was empty)
b) To find time and date: date
c) To go from Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa to Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin (move up one directory) : cd ..
d) To list current directory: ls
  To remove HW3_MayaSosa (with confirmation): rm -r -i HW3_MayaSosa
e) To list current directory with long output: ls -la
  To list current directory in reverse time order and human friendly: ls -ltr -lh

Problem 3:
a)Opened Github Desktop clicked top left Current Repository > Add > Create New Repository...
  Named it HW3_repository, checked initialize with a README, and added description "Practice for HW3"
  Under 'Repository' clicked 'Open in Command Prompt'
  git status to check if the repository was there and git init to initialize repository
  Set up username and email: git config --global user.name MayaJaydes; git config --global user.email Maya.Jaydes@knights.ucf.edu
b) In files (on computer) selected 0-PHZ3150-MayaSosa-Log and selected 'Copy to'. Copied file to ~Downloads\NUMCOMP\Github\HW3_repository
  Opened Github desktop and selected 0-PHZ3150_MayaSosa-Log and in description wrote "Commiting log for HW3 Problem 3b" and selected 'Commit to main'
  On the top right I selected 'Publish Repository' and followed the prompts to publish my repository to the Github website
c) In Files (on computer) selected Handin folder and selected 'Copy to'. Copied folder to ~Downloads\NUMCOMP\Github\HW3_repository. Now Github will keep track of the folder.
d) In files (on computer) selected test.dat and selected 'Copy to'. Copied file to ~Downloads\NUMCOMP\Github\HW3_repository. Opened Github desktop and took a screenshot of added file using keyboard commands (Windows + PrtScr). Renamed screenshot accordingly.
  Selected test.dat on Github desktop and added description "Commiting file for HW3 problem 3d" then clicked 'commit to main'
  Then removed test.dat file from repository by right-clicking and selecting 'Undo Commit' and right-clicking again to select 'Undo changes' which removed test.dat from my HW3_repository
e) Recopied log to HW3_repository and opened Github desktop. When selecting the log Git hub showed the changes I had made to the log since last commiting. Wrote "Commiting changes made to HW3 for Problem 3e" and selected commit to main.
  Copied screenshot taken in problem 3d to handin folder and opened Github desktop. Wrote "Screenshot from HW3 problem 3d commiting for HW3 problem 3e" and selected commit to main.
f) In Github desktop under repository opened command prompt. Typed 'Git log' and pressed enter. Took a screenshot of log using keyboard commands and renamed screenshot appropriately.

Problem 4:
To prepare and submit my hw I will save this log and go to File < Save and then go into Downloads/NUMCOMP, right click on 0-PHZ3150-MayaSosa-Log and send to < compressed (zip) folder.
Drag and drop newly zipped folder to Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin and right click to rename folder HW3_MayaSosa. I will drag and drop the screenshots taken inside zip folder and submit on webcourses for HW 3.
On Github Desktop I will commit any changes made with a description and fetch origin.

*****OUT Tues Sept 8 18:45:57 EST 2021

*****IN Tues Sept 14 1:56:27 EST 2021

Start HW 4

Problem 1:
Opened Files --> ~\Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin and selected 'New Folder'. Named Folder HW4_MayaSosa
Windows Start --> Jupyter Notebook --> Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin\HW4_MayaSosa --> New > Notebook: Python 3
Selected 'Untitled' and changed name to 'HW4_MayaSosa'
Already saved to HW folder and pushed to github

Problem 2:
In Jupyter Notebook HW4_MayaSosa wrote '# Maya Sosa; HW4; Sept 14 14:09:07 EST 2021' in first cell as a comment
In next cell imported numpy and math: 'import numpy as np' and 'import math' and clicked run
In next cell wrote:

print('Problem 2:') #As stated in the hw file to do

m = np.array([10,15,20,40]) #To create arrays that can easily multiply values in the table
a = np.array([5,10,5,3])

F=m*a #Wrote down equation that is to be used
print(F) #Print Results

After running this cell the result was the force was given as an array:
Problem 2:
[ 50 150 100 120]

Next I made the function as required in the HW by writing in cell:

# Problem 2
def force_to_acceleration(F, m):
    """Calculates the acceleration of a body of mass when a force F is applied on it
   Inputs: Force[F]= N ; Mass[m] = kg
   Output: Acceleration[a] = m/s^2"""

    a = F/m
    return a

Clicked run and in next cell tested it out with given values of F(100N,22N,450N) and m(150kg):
  print('Problem 2:')
  print(force_to_acceleration(100,150))
  print(force_to_acceleration(22,150))
  print(force_to_acceleration(450,150))

Which gave corresponding results of a=
  Problem 2:
  0.6666666666666666
  0.14666666666666667
  3.0

Problem 3:
Opened a seperate Jupyter Notebook and retitled it 'HW4_Acceleration_Function'
Created another function as instructed by writing in cell:

# Problem 3
def acceleration(u1, u2, t1, t2):
    """Calculates acceleration of a body using different speeds at different times
    Inputs: Speed 1 [u1] and Speed 2 [u2] = m/s ; Time 1 [t1] and Time 2 [ts] = s
    Output: Acceleration [a] = m/s^2"""

    a = (u2 - u1) / (t2 - t1)
    return a

Saved as .py (python) [File > Download as > Python (.py)]

In HW4_MayaSosa Jupyter Notebook wrote in cell to import function from .py file:
# Problem 3
from HW4_Acceleration_Function import acceleration

To input given numbers and run function wrote in cell:

# Problem 3
t1 = np.array([0,10,14,28,0])
t2 = np.array([2,14,16,32,10])
u1 = np.array([10,15,32,42,20])
u2 = np.array([13,30,36,20,22])

and ran cell, in next cell wrote:

print('Problem 3:')
print(acceleration(u1,u2,t1,t2))

Which gave outputs of a=
Problem 3:
[ 1.5   3.75  2.   -5.5   0.2 ]

Used a calculator to ensure the given results were correct [they were :)]
Wrote that in comments as well as named 2 test cases that could be used to verify code works:
1) If I put in (0,0,) for everything, I should get 0 back (tested, worked)
2) If I put in 1 for everything, I should get 0 back (tested, worked)

Problem 4:
In Atom (what is used for this log) selected 'create repository' and initialized it
Logged into Github on Atom and opened Github Desktop

Some of you had problems with setting up GitHub, starting a repositoryfor your handinfolder and/or naming
correctly your log, files and screenshots for homework2and 3.If so, explain in your log,in detail,all
changes you have doneto correct these errors (e.g., how did you rename your log file and why, how did you start
a new repository, added files and committed them, etc). Remember that these notes should appear as part of
your HW4 log. Do notgo back and alter any of the HW2, HW3 entries of your log!

Problem 5:
Copy Jupyter notebook and zip, Commit/push to github
