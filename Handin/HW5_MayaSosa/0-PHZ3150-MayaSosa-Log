Major: Photonic Science and Engineering
Year: 2nd (Sophomore)
ID: 5114211
How did you hear about this course?
My Advisor in CREOL, Mike McKee recommended this course as a substitute for ENG3211 because it focuses more on python, which I will use as an optics major.
Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.?
Yes
What operating system and version does it run?
Windows 10 64-bit
How much free disk space does it have?
797GB
What operating systems are you comfortable working in?
Mostly just Windows as I have never owned a MAC or any laptop with a operating system other than Windows.
What computer classes have you taken, including high school, extracurricular, etc.?
I have taken computer classes focusing on gaining our certifications in AutoDesk programs such as AutoCAD and Inventor.
Have you ever programmed a computer?
No
In what language(s)? N/A
Summarize your experience: N/A
Have you taken statistics or probability?
Yes, I took and passed the AP test for AP Statistics in high school.
Why are you taking this course?
To fulfill a prerequisite for my major as well as learn more about computer programming with Python.
Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
No particular topics, as I am completely new to programming.
If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly describe your experience:
In my Physics I lab last semester we worked with scientific data and modeling as part of our group experiments. Some of my team members used python to input the data and calculate t' scores though I did not use it. It seemed time consuming and difficult since we all had no idea what Python was.
Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar?  If so, describe:
I was involved in my school's science fair back in middle school.

Finished Survey

*****OUT: Thurs Aug 26 19:12:26 EST 2021


*****IN: Tues Aug 31 21:00:07 EST 2021

Moved NUMCOMP folder to C:\Users\Maya's Computer\Downloads\NUMCOMP from Knights OneDrive (as shown in entry 1)
Created a folder within NUMCOMP called 'Handin' where I will be putting the compressed zip files of the homework that I turn in
Renamed log in Atom from 'HW1_MayaSosa' to 'Main Log'

Opened Microsoft Store and downloaded Ubuntu (previously enabled Windows Subsystem for Linux through Control Panel→Programs→Turn Windows Features On Or Off and restarted computer)
Followed prompts and created a username and password for Ubuntu
Played around with commands learned in class such as: cp, mv, and wc

1a) Done Previously:
Opened Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda) through Windows start button
Followed win10-software.pdf under PHZ3150>Files>Handouts>Installation Instructions in Webcourses to update miniconda and install Jupyter
Typed: "conda update --all" in Anaconda Prompt and followed prompts to update miniconda
Added packages to conda by typing "conda install numpy scipy ipython matplotlib" and following prompts
Installed conda by typing "conda install jupyter" and following prompts
Done Now:
Opened Jupyter notebook Windows Start>Anaconda3 (64-bit)>Jupyter notebook
Copied link shown in notebook by highlighting and using keyboard commands ctrl + c and then pasted in chrome search bar using ctrl + v
Clicked New->Python3->Help->About to get information on Python version (Python 3.9.6) and used keyboard commands start + prtscr to take screenshot, right clicked on file and renamed it HW2_MayaSosa_JupyterNotebook_scrnsht

1b) Vistited https://desktop.github.com/ and clicked download to download Github desktop
Opened .exe file that was downloaded and logged into my existing account that was already synced with classroom phz3150 / phz3150_main_dir
Took a screenshot using keyboard commands used previously, right cicked on file and renamed it HW1_MayaSosa_Gitbub_scrnsht

2) I have no idea what syntax and tokens are so I'm just assuming syntax is word structure and tokens are punctuation
The bird high really flew today.
The! bird flew really, high today?
What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why?
Natural language is very complex and abstract, for example we have multiple meanings for the same word based on the location a speaker comes from. Computers use very precise language for certain actions, and natural language is ever changing and evolving, but as native speakers we can understand the changes where computers cannot.

3) Opened link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and followed Github hello-world tutorial
Went into the class Files>Homework>HW1 and downloaded hw1-survey.txt
Went to phz3150_main_dir-MayaJaydes/HW/HW1/ in Github and dragged and dropped hw1-survey.txt file
Committed the change with message of "Added Files: Added hw1-survey.txt as required for HW2" and took screenshot using previous keyboard commands, renaming it Hw2_MayaSosa_Github_AddedFiles_scrnsht

Start HW 3

Problem 1:
Went to Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin and selected "New Folder"
Renamed folder "HW3_MayaSosa"
Deleted folder (so I could make it again through the terminal in problem 2)

Problem 2:
Under Windows Start opened Ubuntu
a) To make directory: mkdir Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa
  To make that my current directory:  cd Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa
  To list: ls (it was empty)
b) To find time and date: date
c) To go from Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin/HW3_MayaSosa to Downloads/NUMCOMP/Handin (move up one directory) : cd ..
d) To list current directory: ls
  To remove HW3_MayaSosa (with confirmation): rm -r -i HW3_MayaSosa
e) To list current directory with long output: ls -la
  To list current directory in reverse time order and human friendly: ls -ltr -lh

Problem 3:
a)Opened Github Desktop clicked top left Current Repository > Add > Create New Repository...
  Named it HW3_repository, checked initialize with a README, and added description "Practice for HW3"
  Under 'Repository' clicked 'Open in Command Prompt'

*****OUT Tues Sept 8 18:45:57 EST 2021

*****IN Tues Sept 14 1:56:27 EST 2021

Start HW 4

Problem 1:
Opened Files --> ~\Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin and selected 'New Folder'. Named Folder HW4_MayaSosa
Windows Start --> Jupyter Notebook --> Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin\HW4_MayaSosa --> New > Notebook: Python 3
Selected 'Untitled' and changed name to 'HW4_MayaSosa'
Already saved to HW folder and pushed to github

Problem 2:
In Jupyter Notebook HW4_MayaSosa wrote '# Maya Sosa; HW4; Sept 14 14:09:07 EST 2021' in first cell as a comment
In next cell imported numpy and math: 'import numpy as np' and 'import math' and clicked run
In next cell wrote:

print('Problem 2:') #As stated in the hw file to do

m = np.array([10,15,20,40]) #To create arrays that can easily multiply values in the table
a = np.array([5,10,5,3])

F=m*a #Wrote down equation that is to be used
print(F) #Print Results

After running this cell the result was the force was given as an array:
Problem 2:
[ 50 150 100 120]

Next I made the function as required in the HW by writing in cell:

# Problem 2
def force_to_acceleration(F, m):
    """Calculates the acceleration of a body of mass when a force F is applied on it
   Inputs: Force[F]= N ; Mass[m] = kg
   Output: Acceleration[a] = m/s^2"""

    a = F/m
    return a

Clicked run and in next cell tested it out with given values of F(100N,22N,450N) and m(150kg):
  print('Problem 2:')
  print(force_to_acceleration(100,150))
  print(force_to_acceleration(22,150))
  print(force_to_acceleration(450,150))

Which gave corresponding results of a=
  Problem 2:
  0.6666666666666666
  0.14666666666666667
  3.0

Problem 3:
Opened a seperate Jupyter Notebook and retitled it 'HW4_Acceleration_Function'
Created another function as instructed by writing in cell:

# Problem 3
def acceleration(u1, u2, t1, t2):
    """Calculates acceleration of a body using different speeds at different times
    Inputs: Speed 1 [u1] and Speed 2 [u2] = m/s ; Time 1 [t1] and Time 2 [ts] = s
    Output: Acceleration [a] = m/s^2"""

    a = (u2 - u1) / (t2 - t1)
    return a

Saved as .py (python) [File > Download as > Python (.py)]

In HW4_MayaSosa Jupyter Notebook wrote in cell to import function from .py file:
# Problem 3
from HW4_Acceleration_Function import acceleration

To input given numbers and run function wrote in cell:

# Problem 3
t1 = np.array([0,10,14,28,0])
t2 = np.array([2,14,16,32,10])
u1 = np.array([10,15,32,42,20])
u2 = np.array([13,30,36,20,22])

and ran cell, in next cell wrote:

print('Problem 3:')
print(acceleration(u1,u2,t1,t2))

Which gave outputs of a=
Problem 3:
[ 1.5   3.75  2.   -5.5   0.2 ]

Used a calculator to ensure the given results were correct [they were :)]
Wrote that in comments as well as named 2 test cases that could be used to verify code works:
1) If I put in (0,0,) for everything, I should get 0 back (tested, worked)
2) If I put in 1 for everything, I should get 0 back (tested, worked)

Problem 4:
Opened Github desktop and created a local repository for my NUMCOMP folder.
Commited w/ comment Handin folder (which I moved 0-PHZ3150-MayaSosa-Log into)
Previously I only created an individual repository for HW3 rather than adding my NUMCOMP and main Handin folder.
Deleted HW3_Repository that was under .git due to already having a copy in my main NUMCOMP folder (which I just put under .git)

Problem 5:
Saved Jupyter notebook and closed out of Jupyter session. Checked to make sure HW4_MayaSosa.ipynb was saved under ~Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin\HW4_MayaSosa along with other .py file created and once saved will copy this log into HW4_MayaSosa as well.
Will right click on HW4_MayaSosa folder and zip file. Then open Github Desktop and find changes made to Handin folder and commit w/ comment.
After taking a screenshot of committed changed I will also add it to the zip file before submitting on webcourses to HW4.

 Opened Github desktop, pushed to Github
 Using heading/markdown in first cell wrote name, assignment #, and date and in second cell used markdown to write 'Problem 1'
 In next cell imported numpy

 Problem 2:
 Used markdown to write 'Problem 2'
 Emailed prof because I don't understand the difference between lists and arrays
 Found out I could do 'list(np.arange())' or 'list(range())' to create a list for velocity and time from x to y with a step of z.
 Created lists according to instructions and printed both as well as the 3rd to 5th and 8th element from the velocity list
 Copied HW4_Accelectation_Function from HW4_MayaSosa to HW5_MayaSosa folder and from it imported acceleration function into current notebook
 Used help on acceleration function to recall inputs of function
 Used imported function to calculate acceleration of given velocity/time pairs (elements 3-4, 4-5, and 5-8 of each list) and wrote an informative statement with the answers
 Checked results with calculator
 Changed 5th element in velocity to 40 and printed new velocity list

 Problem 3:
 Used markdown to write 'Problem 3'
 Created numpy array x from 1 to and including 100 with a step of 0.1
 Printed shape (1001) and type of x (<class 'numpy.ndarray'>)
 Printed x and then printed it's max, min, and mean in one line (100, 0, 50)
 Printed x-52
 Printed 0.05 * x

 Problem 4:
 Used markdown to write 'Problem 4'
 Created list titled student_h with values 5.01, 4.10, 6.02, 5.07, and 6.11
 Created function to return a list of each height in list form [m,cm] called ft_to_m_cm and wrote informative docstring
 To be continued

 Problem 5:
 Used markdown to write 'Problem 5'
 Created function in a separate file titled 'displacement' that calculates total displacement of a body during a time interval using initial speed and a constant acceleration and wrote informative docstring
 Saved as Displacement_Function.py file in ~Downloads\NUMCOMP\Handin\HW5_MayaSosa
 Imported function into main HW file
 Made lists for given values of initial speed, acceleration, and time and used it to calculate total displacement for each printed with informative statements
 Checked calculations with a calculator separately to ensure they were correct.

 Saved log and will finish HW5 later
